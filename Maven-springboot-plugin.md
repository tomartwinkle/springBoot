## Spring boot and Spring framework
| Term                 | Role                                                                                          |

| **Spring Framework** | The core building block (beans, DI, MVC, AOP, etc.)                                           |
| **Spring Boot**      | A convenience layer on top of Spring to make development faster, cleaner, and more productive |

Spring Boot uses Spring Framework underneath. It’s not a replacement — it’s a wrapper that makes using Spring easier.
If you’re using Spring Boot, you’re already using Spring Framework.
But with Boot, you get auto-configuration, embedded server, and a lot of tools that help you focus on writing business logic instead of setup
